  abstract: "In this blog post, I aim to shed light on the pressing issue of higher education funding in the UK. As an academic, I believe that this issue is of great importance. The current funding model is unsustainable, and I will illustrate how this problem affects two universities that I am familiar with: the University of Kent, where I completed my PhD, and my current institution, the University of Exeter."

  abstract: "I have made significant contributions to the field of machine learning and nature-inspired computational techniques through my publications. My research journey began by introducing a tabu local search heuristic to particle swarm optimization, which effectively addressed a Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP). I then presented further enhancements to this algorithm in subsequent papers."
