  abstract: "In this blog post, I aim to shed light on the pressing issue of higher education funding in the UK. As an academic, I believe that this issue is of great importance. The current funding model is unsustainable, and I will illustrate how this problem affects two universities that I am familiar with: the University of Kent, where I completed my PhD, and my current institution, the University of Exeter."
